Chromeconomist
==============
  This is the source code for the bot developed by /u/Eliminioa in response to the dying Chroma Market. It will provide an automated economy, in which every player will be able to participate with little hardship. It's aim is to add the Chroma experience, bot in terms of lore and RPing, and in terms of battle. If approved by the CoK, the bot will be evolved further to introduce bonuses to players and territories which develop their economies in terms of in-battle buffs. 

How It Works:
  There are three types of basic resources which any player can produce: food, material, and luxury. By themselves, these resources don't do anything for the player. However, once the player has sufficient resources, he or she can use it to create more useful resources. These can then be used to build buildings, create even more useful supplies, or be traded with other players for different materials. Players are automatically credited with an amount of a single type of resource every hour. The type of resource they produce is up to them, and can be changed at any time. The amount they produce is based on their homeland, and any bonus-giving items or buildings they have.

Commands:
All commands must be made as PMs to /u/Chromeconomist. The following are currently enable commands:
'balance': returns a PM reply with the senders account balance on it. 
'produce food/material/luxury': changes the type of resource the player produces every hour to the type they specify
'create # item': attempts to create the item specified in the amount given for the user. If the user has enough materials, the user is      credited with the item, and the required materials are subtracted from their account. If not, the user is notified.

In The Works:
a 'trade # item for # item with player' command, which allows one user to initiate a trade with another. The bot sends a PM to the player specified asking if the given terms are alright. If the player responds affirmatively, then the trade is performed.
